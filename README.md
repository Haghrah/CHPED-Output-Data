# CHPED-Output-Data
Outputs of solving CHPED problem

In order to see the CHP units output plot, download the whole repository and run the python scripts corresponded to the test systems. The script will ask you for entering the execution index. Enter the index (Since the algorithm is run 100 times to solve the CHPED problem, enter a number between 1 and 100.) and see the plots. You can zoom in on the polygonal corners for a better view.
